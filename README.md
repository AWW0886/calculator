# calculator
OMG again... lol...

JULY update:
Decided to go with adding another display for the previous equation.  This should suffice for solving how to implement the result into the next equation, as per directions: step 7.

JULY update #2:
Bug with the decimal button enabling after deletion of operator even though there is a decimal in equation[0] has been solved!  Seems to be bug free... now all that's left is CSS hopefully...

JULY update #3:
I think it's done! Very simple calculator, as directed.  Perhaps in the future, will add +/- so I can multiple with a negative number.  Got to try out new things in CSS such as box-shadow and linear-gradient.  Happy overall and feel good about submitting!
